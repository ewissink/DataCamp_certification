# DataCamp Certification for Data Science Associate
<img src="https://github.com/ewissink/DataCamp_certification/blob/main/DS%20Associate%20-%20badge%20with%20outline.png" align="right" width="100px"/> In April 2023, I finished coursework in data science through DataCamp that covered statistics, exploratory analyses, data visualization, modeling, and machine learning.

At the end of those classes, I took two exams and a completed practical project in order to earn my data science certificate. The code used in the project is available [here](https://github.com/ewissink/DataCamp_certification/blob/main/notebook.ipynb). There, I used a provided data file about electric bikes, then cleaned up the data, created visualizations, and generated two machine learning models for classification.

This work solidified my knowledge of Python and gave me formalized class in machine learning, and I have since used these skills extensively in my work.
